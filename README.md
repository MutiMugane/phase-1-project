# phase-1-project

The project is a simple Article app. This single paged project takes Articles from a public API and displays them.
the displayed articles have been retreived by Fetch which facilitates reception of this data. 
the data is received in the form of JSON object which are added into the page.

A feedback section has been added to the end of the page to make the page interactive.

A little color has been added, for user appeal.
